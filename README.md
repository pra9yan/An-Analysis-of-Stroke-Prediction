## Introduction

The goal of this project is to provide insights into stroke prediction through a comprehensive analysis of relevant data. Whether you're a healthcare professional, data scientist, or someone interested in public health, this repository aims to offer valuable information and visualizations related to stroke risk factors.

## Data Sources

The analysis relies on datasets from reputable sources, including:

- [Stroke Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset) - Description of the health-related dataset.

Please refer to the respective sources for more information about the datasets used in this analysis.

## Analysis

The analysis covers a wide range of aspects, such as:

- Health metrics (e.g., blood pressure, glucose levels, etc.).
- Lifestyle factors (e.g., smoking habits, physical activity, etc.).
- Correlation between various features and stroke occurrences.

The code for the analysis can be found in the [analysis](/analysis) directory.

## Findings

### Findings: Relationship Between Age and Average Glucose Level

One of the intriguing aspects explored in the analysis is the relationship between age and average glucose level. Here are the key findings:

#### 1. Age Groups and Average Glucose Level Distribution

- **Visualization:** Visual representations, such as scatter plots and age-grouped histograms, illustrate the distribution of average glucose levels across different age groups.
  
- **Observation:** The analysis indicates varying patterns in average glucose levels among distinct age cohorts. Understanding these patterns can contribute to assessing the risk of strokes in different age demographics.

#### 2. Correlation Analysis

- **Correlation Coefficient:** Statistical analysis reveals the correlation coefficient between age and average glucose level.

- **Insights:** The correlation analysis helps uncover the strength and direction of the relationship. A positive correlation may suggest that as age increases, average glucose levels tend to rise.

#### 3. Age-Stratified Stroke Incidence

- **Insights:** Stratifying stroke incidence based on age and average glucose levels provides insights into the vulnerability of specific age groups. It enables the identification of age ranges where the impact of elevated glucose levels on stroke risk is most pronounced.

#### 4. Machine Learning Predictions

- **Predictive Modeling:** Utilizing machine learning models, the analysis explores the predictive power of age and average glucose level in forecasting stroke occurrences.

- **Model Performance:** Evaluation metrics, such as accuracy and precision, provide an understanding of how well the model predicts strokes based on age and average glucose levels.

These findings contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the intricate relationship between age and average glucose levels in the context of stroke prediction.
